- Architecting and Developing LightChain was part of my Ph.D. thesis. LightChain is the **first DHT-based** blockchain with **asymptotic logarithmic** operational complexities, and storage load balancing that can survive under the **malicious majority** of nodes.
- LightChain paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS) (Link will be available here).
- LightChain also has been patented under the publication number of [WO2020197514](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020197514).
- A proof-of-concept implementation of LightChain is available [here](https://github.com/yhassanzadeh13/lightchain-container).
- The proof-of-concept of LightChain which has been published [as a demo paper in IEEE ICBC 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13203.pdf) the [presentation is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7ouoHgf82I).
