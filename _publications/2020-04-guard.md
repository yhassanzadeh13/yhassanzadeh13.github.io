Skip Graphs belong to the family of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) structures that are utilized as routing overlays in various peer-to-peer applications including blockchains, cloud storage, and social networks. In a Skip Graph overlay, any misbehavior of peers during the routing of a query compromises the system functionality. Guard is the first authenticated search mechanism for Skip Graphs, enables reliable search operation in a fully decentralized manner. In this demo paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of Guard on Skip Graph nodes as well as a deployment demo scenario.
