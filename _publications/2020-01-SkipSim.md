SkipSim is an offline Skip Graph simulator that enables Skip Graph-based algorithms including blockchains and P2P cloud storage to be simulated, while preserving their scalability and decentralized nature. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Skip Graph simulator that provides several features for experimentation on Skip Graph-based overlay networks. In this demo paper, we present SkipSim features, its architecture, as well as a sample blockchain demo scenario.
