Skip Graphs are Distributed Hash Table (DHT)based data structures that are immensely utilized as routing overlays in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications. In this demo paper, we present the software architecture of our open-source implementation of Skip Graph middleware in Java. We also present a demo scenario on configuration and constructing an overlay of Skip Graph processes in a fully decentralized manner. Our implementation is capable of hosting data objects at the Skip Graph processes and serving as a P2P data storage platform as well. Our middleware implementation provides an open-source platform to support Skip Graph-based applications on top of it.
