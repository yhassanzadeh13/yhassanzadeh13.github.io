LightChain is the first Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based blockchain with a logarithmic asymptotic message and memory complexity. In this demo paper, we present the software architecture of our open-source implementation of LightChain, as well as a novel deployment scenario of the entire LightChain system on a single machine aiming at results reproducibility.
