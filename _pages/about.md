## About Me: 
I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering expertise in architecting Distributed Systems, Blockchains, Cryptography, Privacy, and Security. I am currently working as a Senior Distributed Systems Engineer at [DapperLabs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/) in Vancouver, Canada, developing a next generation blockchain system called [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/). Before joining DapperLabs, I was a joint research and teaching assistant at [Cryptography, Privacy, and Security](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr) and [Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks]() laboratories.
